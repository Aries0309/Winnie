# 高级语言程序设计

本书以问题求解为核心，在分析问题、解决问题的过程中融入 C/C++ 结构化程序设计的思想和方法，立足于专业基本功的训练和应用工程型人才的培养。本书体系结构新颖独特，内容叙述深入透彻，含有丰富的案例和习题，并有配套的习题解答和实验指导。书中的每个章节都围绕某个案例问题展开，按照“问题描述、输入和输出样例、问题分析、算法设计、程序实现（隐含由读者完成的编译运行测试）及几个小节的问题求解相关的知识点讨论”来组织教材，各种语法现象和程序设计方法只有用到时才讨论，自然而然地出现在读者面前，符合人们的认知规律，容易理解便于掌握。

This book takes problem solving as the core, integrates the ideas and methods of C/C++ structured programming in the process of analyzing and solving problems, and is based on the training of professional basic skills and the cultivation of applied engineering talents. The structure of this book is novel and unique, and the content is described thoroughly and thoroughly. Each chapter in the book revolves around a case problem, followed by "problem description, input and output samples, problem analysis, algorithm design, program implementation (implied by the reader to compile and run tests), and several subsections of the problem. To organize teaching materials, various grammatical phenomena and programming methods are discussed only when they are used, and they naturally appear in front of readers, which conforms to people's cognitive laws and is easy to understand and grasp.

本书可作为高等院校计算机相关专业 C/C++ 结构化程序设计课程的首选教材，也可以供非专业的 C 语言程序设计等级考试和广大程序设计爱好者选用。

This book can be used as the preferred teaching material for C/C++ structured programming courses for computer-related majors in colleges and universities, and can also be used for non-professional C language programming grade exams and programming enthusiasts.
